      <br /><br />
      I currently work at a company called Homeflow, where I fix bugs, carry out features and work on larger projects as part of strategic development, theme builds and other fun stuff. 
      <br /><br />
      I previously worked at Learning People as a marketing executive, where I did technical work for landing pages and emails, which included designing these and working with metrics to improve elements such as SEO.
